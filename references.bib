In our survey of 259 designers, 86\% reported that the behavior is more difficult to prototype than the appearance. Often (78\% of the time), designing the behavior requires collaborating with developers, but 76\% of designers reported that communicatin1g the behavior to developers was more difficult than the appearance. Other results include that annotations such as arrows and paragraphs of text are used on top of sketches and storyboards to explain behaviors, and designers want to explore multiple versions of behaviors, but todaypsilas tools make this difficult. The results provide new ideas for future tools.},

Over 1946–2009, countries with public debt/GDP ratios above 90\% averaged 2.2\% real annual GDP growth, not −0.1\% as published. The published results for (i) median GDP growth rates for the 1946–2009 period and (ii) mean and median GDP growth figures over 1790–2009 are all distorted by similar methodological errors, although the magnitudes of the distortions are somewhat smaller than with the mean figures for 1946–2009. Contrary to Reinhart and Rogoff’s broader contentions, both mean and median GDP growth when public debt levels exceed 90\% of GDP are not dramatically different from when the public debt/GDP ratios are lower. The relationship between public debt and GDP growth varies significantly by period and country. Our overall evidence refutes RR’s claim that public debt/GDP ratios above 90\% consistently reduce a country’s GDP growth.},

Similar to software developers, professional spreadsheet users demand support for maintaining and transferring their spreadsheets. In this paper, we first study the problems and information needs of professional spreadsheet users by means of a survey conducted at a large financial company. Based on these needs, we then present an approach that extracts this information from spreadsheets and presents it in a compact and easy to understand way, with leveled dataflow diagrams. Our approach comes with three different views on the dataflow that allow the user to analyze the dataflow diagrams in a top-down fashion. To evaluate the usefulness of the proposed approach, we conducted a series of interviews as well as nine case studies in an industrial setting. The results of the evaluation clearly indicate the demand for and usefulness of our approach in ease the understanding of spreadsheets.},

However, there has been little evaluation of these dependability devices on spreadsheets in actual use by end users. To assist in the process of evaluating these methodologies, we have assembled a corpus of spreadsheets from a variety of sources. We have ensured that these spreadsheets are suitable for evaluating dependability devices in Microsoft Excel (the most commonly used commercial spreadsheet environment) and have measured a variety of feature of these spreadsheets to aid researchers in selecting subsets of the corpus appropriate to their needs.},

	abstract = {At times, programmers work opportunistically, emphasizing speed and ease of development over code robustness and maintainability. They do this to prototype, ideate, and discover; to understand as quickly as possible what the right solution is. Despite its importance, opportunistic programming remains poorly understood when compared with traditional software engineering. Through fieldwork and a laboratory study, we observed five characteristics of opportunistic programming: Programmers build software from scratch using high-level tools, often add new functionality via copyand-paste, iterate more rapidly than in traditional development, consider code to be impermanent, and face unique debugging challenges because their applications often comprise many languages and tools composed without upfront design. Based on these characteristics, we discuss future research on tools for debugging, code foraging and reuse, and documentation that are specifically targeted at this style of development.},

	abstract = {Computer system administrators are the unsung heroes of the information age, working behind the scenes to configure, maintain, and troubleshoot the computer infrastructure that underlies much of modern life. However, little can be found in the literature about the practices and problems of these highly specialized computer users. We conducted a series of field studies in large corporate data centers, observing organizations, work practices, tools, and problem-solving strategies of system administrators. We found system administrators operate within large-scale, complex environments that present significant technical, social, cognitive, and business challenges. In this paper, we describe system administrator tool use in critical, high-cost, labor-intensive work through observational, survey, and interview data. We discuss our findings concerning administrator needs for coordinating work, maintaining situation awareness, planning and rehearsing complex procedures, building tools, and supporting complicated interleaved workflows.},

@inproceedings{badame_refactoring_2012,
	title = {Refactoring meets spreadsheet formulas},
	doi = {10.1109/ICSM.2012.6405299},
	abstract = {The number of end-users who write spreadsheet programs is at least an order of magnitude larger than the number of trained programmers who write professional software. We studied a corpus of 3691 spreadsheets and we found that their formulas are riddled with the same smells that plague professional software: hardcoded constants, duplicated expressions, unnecessary complexity, and unsanitized input. These make spreadsheets difficult to read and expensive to maintain. Like automated refactoring in the object-oriented domain, spreadsheet refactoring can be transformative. In this paper we present seven refactorings for spreadsheet formulas implemented in RefBook, a plugin for Microsoft Excel. To evaluate the usefulness of RefBook, we employed three kinds of empirical methods. First, we conducted a User Survey with 28 Excel users to find out whether they preferred the refactored formulas. Second, we conducted a Controlled Experiment with the same 28 participants to measure their productivity when doing manual refactorings. Third, we performed a Retrospective Case Study on the EUSES Spreadsheet Corpus with 3691 spreadsheets to determine how often we could apply the refactorings supported by RefBook. The results show: (i) users prefer the improved quality of refactored formulas, (ii) RefBook is faster and more reliable than manual refactoring, and (iii) the refactorings are widely applicable. On average RefBook is able to apply the refactorings in less than half the time that users performed the refactorings manually. 92.54\% of users introduced errors or new smells into the spreadsheet or were unable to complete the task.},
