	abstract = {Testing and static analysis can help root out bugs in programs, but not in data. This paper introduces data debugging, an approach that combines program analysis and statistical analysis to automatically find potential data errors. Since it is impossible to know a priori whether data are erroneous, data debugging instead locates data that has a disproportionate impact on the computation. Such data is either very important, or wrong. Data debugging is especially useful in the context of data-intensive programming environments that intertwine data with programs in the form of queries or formulas. We present the first data debugging tool, CheckCell, an add-in for Microsoft Excel. CheckCell identifies cells that have an unusually high impact on the spreadsheet's computations. We show that CheckCell is both analytically and empirically fast and effective. We show that it successfully finds injected typographical errors produced by a generative model trained with data entry from 169,112 Mechanical Turk tasks. CheckCell is more precise and efficient than standard outlier detection techniques. CheckCell also automatically identifies a key flaw in the infamous Reinhart and Rogoff spreadsheet.},

To enable integration and reusability of scientific spreadsheet data it is important to explicate the underlying concepts and relations. In this paper we explore to which extent the conceptual model of a research project can be recognized in its spreadsheet implementation. We perform a manual analysis of spreadsheets of existing research from the domain of environmental science. We formally describe the semantics of the spreadsheets in an ontology and record our approach in heuristics. We interview the original developers of the spreadsheets to compare our findings with their views. Our reconstructed conceptual model does not conflict with the developer’s views, but represents a different perspective, as the developers are primarily focussed on the calculation workflow.},

These models are typically described in a paper or a report, which serves as single source of information on the underlying research project. As the calculation workflow in these models is not made explicit, readers are not able to fully understand how the research results are calculated, and trace them back to the underlying spreadsheets. This paper proposes a methodology for semi-automatically deriving the calculation workflow underlying a set of spreadsheets. The starting point of our methodology is the cell dependency graph, representing all spreadsheet cells and connections. We automatically aggregate all cells in the graph that represent instances and duplicates of the same quantities, based on analysis of the formula syntax. Subsequently, we use a set of heuristics, incorporating knowledge on spreadsheet design, computational procedures and domain knowledge, to select those quantities, that are relevant for understanding the calculation workflow. We explain and illustrate our methodology by actually applying it on three sets of spreadsheets from existing research projects in the domains of environmental and life science. Results from these case studies show that our constructed calculation models approximate the ground truth calculation workflows, both in terms of content and size, but are not a perfect match.},

One reason for this situation is the low-level, cell-oriented development process of spreadsheets.We improve this process by introducing and formalizing a higher-level object-oriented model termed ClassSheet. While still following the tabular look-and feel of spreadsheets, ClassSheets allow the developer to express explicitly business object structures within a spreadsheet, which is achieved by integrating concepts from the UML (Unified Modeling Language). A stepwise automatic transformation process generates a spreadsheet application that is consistent with the ClassSheet model. Thus, by deploying the formal underpinning of ClassSheets, a large variety of errors can be prevented that occur in many existing spreadsheet applications today.The presented ClassSheet approach links spreadsheet applications to the object-oriented modeling world and advocates an automatic model-driven development process for spreadsheet applications of high quality.},

	abstract = {Many errors in spreadsheet formulas can be avoided if spreadsheets are built automatically from higher-level models that can encode and enforce consistency constraints. However, designing such models is time consuming and requires expertise beyond the knowledge to work with spreadsheets. Legacy spreadsheets pose a particular challenge to the approach of controlling spreadsheet evolution through higher-level models, because the need for a model might be overshadowed by two problems: (A) The benefit of creating a spreadsheet is lacking since the legacy spreadsheet already exists, and (B) existing data must be transferred into the new model-generated spreadsheet. To address these problems and to support the model-driven spreadsheet engineering approach, we have developed a tool that can automatically infer ClassSheet models from spreadsheets. To this end, we have adapted a method to infer entity/relationship models from relational database to the spreadsheets/ClassSheets realm. We have implemented our techniques in the HaExcel framework and integrated it with the ViTSL/Gencel spreadsheet generator, which allows the automatic generation of refactored spreadsheets from the inferred ClassSheet model. The resulting spreadsheet guides further changes and provably safeguards the spreadsheet against a large class of formula errors. The developed tool is a significant contribution to spreadsheet (reverse) engineering, because it fills an important gap and allows a promising design method (ClassSheets) to be applied to a huge collection of legacy spreadsheets with minimal effort.},

Over 1946–2009, countries with public debt/GDP ratios above 90\% averaged 2.2\% real annual GDP growth, not −0.1\% as published. The published results for (i) median GDP growth rates for the 1946–2009 period and (ii) mean and median GDP growth figures over 1790–2009 are all distorted by similar methodological errors, although the magnitudes of the distortions are somewhat smaller than with the mean figures for 1946–2009. Contrary to Reinhart and Rogoff’s broader contentions, both mean and median GDP growth when public debt levels exceed 90\% of GDP are not dramatically different from when the public debt/GDP ratios are lower. The relationship between public debt and GDP growth varies significantly by period and country. Our overall evidence refutes RR’s claim that public debt/GDP ratios above 90\% consistently reduce a country’s GDP growth.},

Similar to software developers, professional spreadsheet users demand support for maintaining and transferring their spreadsheets. In this paper, we first study the problems and information needs of professional spreadsheet users by means of a survey conducted at a large financial company. Based on these needs, we then present an approach that extracts this information from spreadsheets and presents it in a compact and easy to understand way, with leveled dataflow diagrams. Our approach comes with three different views on the dataflow that allow the user to analyze the dataflow diagrams in a top-down fashion. To evaluate the usefulness of the proposed approach, we conducted a series of interviews as well as nine case studies in an industrial setting. The results of the evaluation clearly indicate the demand for and usefulness of our approach in ease the understanding of spreadsheets.},

They do this to prototype, ideate, and discover; to understand as quickly as possible what the right solution is. Despite its importance, opportunistic programming remains poorly understood when compared with traditional software engineering. Through fieldwork and a laboratory study, we observed five characteristics of opportunistic programming: Programmers build software from scratch using high-level tools, often add new functionality via copyand-paste, iterate more rapidly than in traditional development, consider code to be impermanent, and face unique debugging challenges because their applications often comprise many languages and tools composed without upfront design. Based on these characteristics, we discuss future research on tools for debugging, code foraging and reuse, and documentation that are specifically targeted at this style of development.},

	abstract = {The number of end-users who write spreadsheet programs is at least an order of magnitude larger than the number of trained programmers who write professional software. We studied a corpus of 3691 spreadsheets and we found that their formulas are riddled with the same smells that plague professional software: hardcoded constants, duplicated expressions, unnecessary complexity, and unsanitized input. These make spreadsheets difficult to read and expensive to maintain. Like automated refactoring in the object-oriented domain, spreadsheet refactoring can be transformative. In this paper we present seven refactorings for spreadsheet formulas implemented in RefBook, a plugin for Microsoft Excel. To evaluate the usefulness of RefBook, we employed three kinds of empirical methods. First, we conducted a User Survey with 28 Excel users to find out whether they preferred the refactored formulas. Second, we conducted a Controlled Experiment with the same 28 participants to measure their productivity when doing manual refactorings. Third, we performed a Retrospective Case Study on the EUSES Spreadsheet Corpus with 3691 spreadsheets to determine how often we could apply the refactorings supported by RefBook. The results show: (i) users prefer the improved quality of refactored formulas, (ii) RefBook is faster and more reliable than manual refactoring, and (iii) the refactorings are widely applicable. On average RefBook is able to apply the refactorings in less than half the time that users performed the refactorings manually. 92.54\% of users introduced errors or new smells into the spreadsheet or were unable to complete the task.},
